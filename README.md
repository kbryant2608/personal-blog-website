Personal Blog Website @Udacity<br>

The name of my personal blog website is "StudyGold."

<p>Reviewer: I have submitted this project three times. On my last two reviews, it was requested that my root directory be organized, as per the rubric.<br> 
I'm not sure if this is because I am using VS Code to write my code, but every time I create a new folder to organize, i.e "Assets," and then move my CSS code to the new folder, the links end
up broken and I am spending hours trying to figure out why I cannot create a new folder and move my assets in there without CSS not displaying properly.<br>
Please help!<br>
This is the only change I needed to make on my last review, my website is in good shape but I cannot create new files to organize my assets. Thank you!</p>
